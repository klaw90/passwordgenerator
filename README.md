# PASSWORD GENERATOR

Description: A password is generated randomly per user criteria.

When user clicks "Generate Password" they are first prompted for password length. If it is less than 8 or more than 50, the user is prompted to enter a password length within the appointed ange. This will loop until the user enters an appropriate number.

The program then prompts the user to confirm what criteria they want the password to have. If the user selects none to all criteria, the program will ask it to select at least one and will loop back through the prompts.

When all criteria has been met, a randomly generated password will be created.
